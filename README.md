# Traffic-Monitoring-in-Bangladesh

In this project, you'll be working with traffic video feed data from Dhaka, Bangladesh. The goal is to take each frame of video and detect and label objects such as cars and people in real-time. You'll use both a pre-trained model but extend an existing model to detect custom objects for the task of analyzing traffic feed data.

Some of the things you'll learn are:

How to work with XML data that have bounding box data
How to extract frames from video files
How to apply the pretrained YOLO object detection model
How to train YOLO to extend it to detect custom objects
How to augment data to enhance a model's ability to generalize when training
